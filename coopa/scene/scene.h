 * @class Scene
 * @brief Owns the root SceneObjects and provides generic hierarchy-wide queries.
 *
 * **Single-owner + deferred commands.** At any instant, at most one thread
 * may call a non-const method on a given Scene -- this is what lets an
 * engine process several independent Scenes concurrently (one job per
 * Scene) without any locking inside Scene itself: distinct Scene instances
 * share no state. Build with -DCOOPA_SCENE_THREAD_CHECKS=ON (see
 * CMakeLists.txt) to get a runtime assertion if two threads ever call into
 * the same Scene concurrently.
 *
 * Work fanned out *within* one Scene's update (e.g. a system's
 * parallel_for() over its components) must only READ scene state from a
 * worker job -- every write goes through that worker's SceneCommandBuffer
 * (see FrameContext::commands / Scene::commands_for(), and scene_commands.h)
 * instead of calling a mutating Scene/SceneObject method directly. The owner
 * thread applies every buffer's recorded commands, in worker-index order,
 * via flush_commands() -- call it once per frame, after every system has
 * run (late_update() already does this for you).
 *
 * Constructed by SceneLoader (or built up manually via add_root_object()).
 * update()/late_update() run an ordered pipeline of ISceneSystem instances
 * (see scene_system.h) — the recursive Component::update()/late_update()
 * walks are just the two built-in systems (BehaviourSystem,
 * LateBehaviourSystem), auto-installed by every Scene at construction.
 * get_components<T>() / find_objects_with<T>() / find_first_component<T>()
