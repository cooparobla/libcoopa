/**
 * @struct AssetSlot
 * @brief One asset's identity, lifecycle state, and published payload.
 *
 * AssetManager owns every AssetSlot behind a std::unique_ptr in a map keyed
 * by AssetId::hash(), so a slot's address never changes for the lifetime of
 * the manager — every AssetHandle<T> can safely hold a raw AssetSlot*
 * for as long as its refcount keeps the slot alive. Hot reload swaps
 * `payload` in place and increments `revision`, so outstanding handles
 * observe the new payload without ever needing to be reissued; this
 * indirection is the reason AssetHandle beats a raw shared_ptr<T>, which
 * every asset cache in this workspace (gfxcoopa's mesh_cache,
 * uicoopa::UIResourceCache) used until now.
 *
 * Main-thread only: like every GPU-owning type in this workspace (Device,
 * Allocator, CommandPool, ...), an AssetSlot is read and written exclusively
 * from the thread that drives AssetManager::update(). A loader's decode()
 * stage may run on a worker thread, but it only ever touches its own
 * decoded intermediate value passed through AssetManager's PendingLoad —
 * never the slot itself.
