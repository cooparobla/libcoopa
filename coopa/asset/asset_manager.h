 * @class AssetManager
 * @brief Owns loader registration, slot caching, async loading, and hot reload for every asset type.
 *
 * Downstream packages register their own asset types by providing a loader
 * (see IAssetLoader/TypedAssetLoader) — gfxcoopa registers Mesh, Texture,
 * Shader; uicoopa registers Sprite, Font — exactly as they already register
 * scene components via coopa::scene::SceneLoader::register_component_parser.
 * AssetManager itself never names any of those types.
 *
 * Main-thread only: construct, register loaders on, load from, and destroy
 * an AssetManager from a single thread — the same thread that owns the
 * Device/Allocator/CommandPool it hands to its registered loaders. The one
 * exception is a loader's decode() stage, which AssetManager itself may run
 * on a worker thread when load_async() is used; decode() implementations
 * must not touch the GPU (see IAssetLoader).
 *
 * @code
 * coopa::job::JobEngine engine;
 * coopa::asset::AssetManager assets(&engine);
 * assets.add_search_root(std::string(ROOT_DIR) + "/assets");
 * assets.register_loader<Mesh>(std::make_unique<MeshLoader>(device, allocator, cmd_pool));
 *
 * coopa::asset::AssetHandle<Mesh> mesh = assets.load<Mesh>("meshes/cube.yaml");
 * // Per frame:
 * assets.update(delta_time);
 * // Before Device/Allocator are destroyed:
 * assets.shutdown();
 * @endcode
