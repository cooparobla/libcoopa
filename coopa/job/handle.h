/**
 * @file handle.h
 * @brief Defines JobHandle/CounterPool: generation-tagged, individually-reclaimed
 *        handles for tracking asynchronous job completion.
 *
 * Earlier revisions of this pool were an untagged bump allocator: every slot was
 * only ever freed in bulk by CounterPool::reset(), which meant a handle could not
 * outlive a single begin_frame()/end_frame() pair, and a second begin_frame() from
 * anywhere in the process would silently invalidate every other subsystem's
 * outstanding handles. That forced every long-lived subsystem (Scene, AssetManager)
 * to either own a private JobEngine or fight over exclusive ownership of the frame
 * boundary.
 *
 * This revision replaces the bump allocator with a lock-free free list of
 * generation-tagged slots, so individual handles can be allocated and released at
 * any time, independent of any frame boundary, while a stale handle (one whose
 * slot has since been recycled) can still be told apart from a live one.
 *
 * A slot's lifetime tracks two independent things:
 *  - The **job counter**: how many submitted-but-incomplete jobs still reference
 *    this handle. is_complete() reads this, and it is what wakes dependency
 *    waiters (see dependency_graph.h) -- it must become zero the instant the
 *    tracked work finishes, regardless of whether anyone has "closed" the handle.
 *  - The **open** flag: whether the creator (whoever called create_handle() /
 *    submit_jobs()) has declared it is done with the handle, via close_handle()
 *    or a ScopedJobHandle's destructor. This exists solely to know when the slot
 *    is safe to recycle -- a handle that hits a job counter of zero may still
 *    receive more submissions later (the fan-in pattern: submit some jobs, let
 *    them finish, submit more against the very same handle), so counter-hits-zero
 *    alone is not sufficient license to hand the slot to someone else.
 *
 * A slot is only returned to the free list once BOTH are true -- job counter is
 * zero AND the handle has been closed -- decided via a single CAS-guarded
 * "reclaimed" flag so exactly one of the two racing paths (the completing job vs.
 * the closing caller) performs the reclaim. See CounterPool::close() and
 * CounterPool::try_reclaim_after_completion().
