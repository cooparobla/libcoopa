/**
 * @file work_stealing_deque.h
 * @brief Lock-free Chase-Lev work-stealing deque for the job system.
 *
 * Implements the Chase-Lev dynamic circular work-stealing deque as described
 * in "Dynamic Circular Work-Stealing Deque" (Chase & Lev, 2005). The owner
 * thread pushes/pops from the bottom (no contention), while thieves steal
 * from the top using a single CAS operation.
 *
 * This implementation uses a fixed-capacity circular buffer (no dynamic
 * resizing) for deterministic memory behavior in realtime applications.
 *
 * @warning Capacity should stay reasonably large relative to how hard any
 * single deque is hammered concurrently (defaults here are in the
 * thousands). A thief's steal() reserves a slot via a CAS on top_ and only
 * *then* reads out of it; the owner is free to wrap the ring buffer around
 * and overwrite that same physical slot with a new push() the moment its own
 * capacity check (based on top_) allows it. Classic Chase-Lev relies on that
 * reuse only happening after the thief's read has had time to complete --
 * true in essentially all real usage, but an artificially tiny capacity
 * under sustained concurrent push()/steal() pressure (e.g. capacity 4 under
 * a tight push loop) can shrink that window enough to observe the race. See
 * test_job_engine_deque_overflow_falls_back_to_global_queue in test.cpp for
 * the concrete tripwire this was found with.

 * @class WorkStealingDeque
 * @brief Lock-free single-producer multi-consumer work-stealing deque.
 *
 * @tparam T The element type. Must be move-constructible.
 *
 * Thread safety guarantees:
 * - push() and pop() may only be called by the **owner** thread.
 * - steal() may be called by **any** thread concurrently.
 * - push/pop and steal operate on opposite ends of the deque, minimizing contention.
 *
 * Memory ordering follows the Chase-Lev paper, expressed entirely through
 * ordered atomic operations rather than standalone atomic_thread_fence calls
 * (ThreadSanitizer does not model bare fences -- ordering must live on the
 * atomic operations themselves to be verifiable under TSan):
 * - bottom_: relaxed load/relaxed-or-seq_cst store from the owner (release
 *   on the common push() path; seq_cst on pop()'s contended path, matching
 *   the seq_cst top_ read it must not be reordered against), seq_cst/acquire
 *   load from thieves.
 * - top_: contended between owner pop() and thief steal() (CAS with seq_cst).
